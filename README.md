# TwicPics Cartridge for Salesforce Commerce Cloud

TwicPics is a real-time image processing service that enables businesses of all sizes to deliver high performing, rich visual content with an easy setup.

## What is TwicPics?
Websites are heavier than ever and the main culprits are images. They eat up network bandwidth and increase the time visitors spend waiting for pages to load. because every passing tenth of a second reduces your website's overall conversion rate, this dramatically impacts revenue.

With all kinds of devices, screen sizes and pixel densities out there, tailoring images is extremely challenging. Depending on the approach, it can complicate server-side architectures by an order of magnitude, makes for convoluted deployment strategies or just kill client-side performance. This is where TwicPics comes in.

TwicPics is a Responsive Image Service Solution (SaaS). It offers on-demand responsive image generation combined with a smart and unobtrusive javascript library, all based around a no-nonsense, testable, URL-based API.

Through TwicPics, developers always point to the biggest, most detailed version of the media. Yet, end-users never see this master image. Instead, an optimized, perfectly sized, device-adapted version is delivered from a server closest to them.
